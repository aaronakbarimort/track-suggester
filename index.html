        <h1>CSS / REACT</h1>
        <h4><span class="userName"></span>, it looks like you might be a great candidate for the CSS/React course path!</h4>
        <p>Front-end developers spend their time making things look and work well, obsessing over layouts, navigation, colors, and design. If this type of work appeals to you, your best bet is to take CSS and Design classes at Epicodus.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="ruby">
        <h1>RUBY / RAILS</h1>
        <h4><span class="userName"></span>, it looks like you might be a great candidate for the Ruby/Rails course path!</h4>
        <p>Ruby is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications. If an app involves users creating accounts, entering information, and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built with Ruby. Ruby became popular because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby, simplified many of the common tasks associated with building web applications. It's most popular with startups and smaller companies who are looking to build their product quickly.</p>

      <div id="java">
        <h1>JAVA / ANDRIOD</h1>
        <h4><span class="userName"></span>, it looks like you might be a great candidate for the JAVA/Android course path!</h4>
        <p>Java is a favorite of enterprise companies, but its appeal is broader as well: it's one of the most popular of all programming languages, and it's used in everything from for high-performance processing to building Android user interfaces. Because Java has been very popular for a very long time and is used in so many applications, it is also a very high-demand language. If you're interested in working for an enterprise-level company, as an Android developer, or in high-performance applications, Java could be a good language to learn.</p>
